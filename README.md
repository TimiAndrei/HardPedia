## Features 🚀

### 1. Project Structure 🏗️

The project uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to separate the concerns of the application. The project is divided into the following packages:

- **Areas:** Contains the Users Identity created with Microsoft Identity Framework and all the login and registration logic.
- **Controllers:** Manages HTTP requests and responses.
- **Data:** Houses the database context and migrations.
- **Models:** Defines the application's data structures.
- **Views:** Presents data to users through Razor pages.

Entity Framework Core is used to interact with the database.

### 2. Database 🗃️

The application utilizes MySQL as the database. Key tables include Subjects, SubjectCategory, Comments, Categories, and the tables generated by Microsoft Identity Framework. These tables are designed to manage relationships and ensure data integrity.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization 🔐

The application leverages ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication and authorization. It supports user registration, login, password recovery, and role-based access control.

### 4. CRUD Operations 📝

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for key entities such as subjects, comments and categories. Each entity has dedicated controllers and views to handle these operations efficiently.

### 5. Search Functionality 🔍

Users can search for posts based on subjects or categories. The search system is in real time and efficient, providing relevant results quickly.

### 6. Application preview 🖼️

This is the landing page where all categories are shown by default with the latest subject posted and the ability to paginate over all subjects, but also search for specify categories or subjects.

If the user is logged in, the Add Subject option will be available. If the user is an admin he can add a new category, or if the user is a moderator he can delete a subject.

The users that created the subjects can edit or delete them.

Each subject can have multiple comments, and the user can add a new comment, edit or delete it later. The moderators can delete any comment.

## Conclusion 🎯

This project was a collaborative effort between two university colleagues. By using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core, we created a forum where users can share and seek knowledge about hard skills. We focused on providing a clear structure, efficient search functionality, and robust authentication to deliver a useful application.
